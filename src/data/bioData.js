    <p>My work seeks to capture the sense of openness and wonder that we experienced in childhood but I also enjoy exploring the intrigue, the unknown and the spiritual in my creations. I seek to explore different fantasy worlds that undoubtedly contain elements of the collective imagination such as Studio Ghibli films, Disney and the anime of the nineties.</p>
    <p>Although I mainly use digital media, my beginnings were with pencil and paper, to which I return occasionally.</p>
    <p>I find inspiration in art, travel, books, music, objects, conversations and everyday moments. My goal is that my work transcends diverse artistic disciplines, formats and narrative media to explore all creative possibilities.</p>
